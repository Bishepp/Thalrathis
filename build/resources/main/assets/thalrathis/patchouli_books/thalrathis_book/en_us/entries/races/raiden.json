Their villages are hidden among the mountain peaks where the storms rage the strongest, and it is said that their ancestors once forged their weapons by channeling the raw power of thunderstorms."

Their connection to the storm is not just physical but spiritual, with each Raiden able to channel powerful bolts of lightning from the heavens. They are also adept in the ancient art of Vocaris, using their mastery of elemental forces to summon and control the energies of the world around them."
