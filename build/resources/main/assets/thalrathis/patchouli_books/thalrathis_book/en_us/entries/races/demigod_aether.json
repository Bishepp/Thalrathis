Their appearance is ethereal, with luminous skin and eyes that shine with the power of the stars. They are said to be blessed by the gods of light, chosen to bring hope and clarity to the world."

Though their hearts are filled with light, they are burdened with the knowledge that their power is also a weapon, one that can bring both salvation and destruction. The Demigod Aether are natural practitioners of Luminus magic."
