      "text": "They are now exiles, cast out by the other races for their cruel and destructive ways. The Illagers' dark magic erodes reality itself,leaving behind only emptiness. They are eternal enemies of the villages, seeking to destroy the structures of civilization and plunge the world into darkness."
