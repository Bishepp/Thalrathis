Their civilization flourished long ago, before the rise of the schools of magic, and their understanding of magic was unparalleled."

      "text": "However, their pursuit of perfection and ultimate knowledge led them to the Finality magic school, a school that mastered all the magic elements and energy, to understand the origin and the end of time and existence. Now, they wander the world as philosophers, their once-great empire lost to history."
