**Thalrathis** is an addon to **[Iron`s Spells and SpellBooks](https://github.com/iron431/irons-spells-n-spellbooks/tree/1.20.1)**. The goal of this mod is to expand the minercraft **endgame** by adding a lot of different weapons, armor sets, staffs, new spells and unique spellbooks.
Although having a dependency on ISS, Thalrathis aims to be a full-fledged interesting mod. 
Created and actively being developed exclusively for **[LemonCraft](https://lemoncraft.ru/)**.
