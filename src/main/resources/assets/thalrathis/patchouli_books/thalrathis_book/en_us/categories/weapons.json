  "description": "In Thalrathis, weapons are more than tools—they are magical extensions of the wielder’s power. Each weapon is infused with the essence of its creator’s magic school, shaping its abilities and appearance. From the fiery Flamara blades to the dark, eldritch Obscurum daggers, these weapons embody the raw forces of nature and the ancient powers of the world.",
