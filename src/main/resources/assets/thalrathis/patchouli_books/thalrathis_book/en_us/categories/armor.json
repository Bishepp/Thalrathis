  "description": "In Thalrathis, armor isn’t just protection—it’s a symbol of power. Crafted from rare materials, imbued with magical essence, and designed to withstand the harshest environments, each piece is as unique as the magic it represents. From the radiant Sanctaris armor to the shadowy Tenebris gear, these sets grant not only physical defense but enhance the wearer’s connection to their chosen magic school.",
